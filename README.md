This is a project developed in Fall 2023 semester, for CS408 - Computer Networks course in Sabancı University. 

This project implements a communication application (DiSUcord -Sabancı University version of Discord-) with a server-client architecture.

The server, developed using C# and .NET, listens on a specific port for incoming client connections. Duplicate name check is done before connection is accepted. The users can subscribe to a channel, unsubscribe or send messages to a subscribed channel. All the actions are managed by the server and informed in the server module. 

The project aims to utilize TCP sockets using C# in order to create a Windows Form Application. The Github profiles for the contributors of this project are listed below:
